# Benchmarking

rep-1 was done separately with benchmark.py. As seen in the logs, not all properties finished as they were run on a pre-emptible queue and some were indeed pre-empted.

rep-2 was done together with benchmark-group.py.

Note: the stored_data.tar.gz in the equilibration directory was untarred and placed at the path `output/stored_data`. I think this may be hardcoded into benchmark/-group.py.
